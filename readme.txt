About This Project
-------------------
You are a new student that has just been admitted to the prestigious school
of the University of Colorado Boulder. Although the school is beautiful and 
magneficent, it has a dark side. Behind all of the university programs and 
interesting classes, there are evil people at this university. You must 
survive the nights on the hill while also maintaining your classes.
